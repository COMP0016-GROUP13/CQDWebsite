            FRONT-END TESTING
        </h2>
        <br>
        <div class="h4 text-center" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em;">
            After doing some research on how to test React and Next.js projects we learnt that a common method is by utilising 
            <a href="https://jestjs.io" style="color: #1CBBFF">Jest</a> and <a href="https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/" style="color: #1CBBFF">Enzyme</a>.

            Enzyme allows us to manipulate or use components in our test suite using built-in methods such as mount (to simulate a component for 
            testing purposes) and simulate (to simulate interactions with components like clicks).
            
            Jest, on the other hand, is an assertion library and test runner. It is an open source JavaScript testing framework which
            is very well documented and has a wide range of APIs which gives us great flexibility to test in a variety of different ways. 
            Another advantage of Jest is that tests are isolated and 
            can be parallelized which allowed us to create a huge test suite that can be run in seconds.
            
            For testing our front-end, we had created 22 test suites with 71 tests in total. After running them, we managed to pass 
            all 71 tests as seen in the diagram below:<br><br>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <img class="mx-auto img-thumbnail" src="static/image/testing/frontend-test.png" style="max-width: 50%;">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- end front-end -->

        <!-- Backend -->
        <h2 style="color:#00a2e8; text-align: center;">
            BACK-END TESTING
        </h2>
        <br>
        <div class="h4 text-center" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em;">
            Continuing from the previous year's iteration, we decided not to unit test the API, because of the complications that may arise when 
            isolating the logic of the APIs from the network handling and database interactions. Therefore, we will again be 
            performing integration testing on our REST API to test the Next.js route handling through to the database interactions.

            We discovered a Node package, <code>openapi-response</code> that links with jest-openapi to assert HTTP responses to match 
            our OpenAPI specification. One major benefit being that we can use our OpenAPI specification in part for testing 
            too, so we don't have to write code again to check for response structure when we already have it in our OpenAPI specification.<br><br>
            
            One major problem with the backend testing is that every action creates unnecessary data that could affect other 
            actions further down the line. We want to isolate not units but whole systems/networks to retrieve correct data 
            from the database. This is why we implement a script (<code>api-test.environment.js</code>) that cleans and add certain seed 
            data for us to use in each test. The script is ran before every test for the system to use and utilises 
            <code>Jest Test Environments</code>
            for the teardowns.
            
            Overall our back-end struggled with responses and words due to different implementations of the scores and dashboards. 
            However, our dashboard still passed all 190 tests from our 13 test suites. The results are illustrated in the following diagram: <br><br>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <img class="mx-auto img-thumbnail" src="static/image/testing/backend-test.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- end backend -->

        <h2 style="color:#00a2e8; text-align: center;">
            END-TO-END TESTING
        </h2>
        <br>
        <div class="h4 text-center" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em;">
            These aim to test the entire system as a whole from a user’s perspective, by programmatically navigating to the site, 
            interacting with it, and asserting that the UI is updated and functions correctly at all times.

            We are using <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer" style="color: #1CBBFF">Puppeteer</a>, a popular Node.js API to programmatically control Chrome, alongside Jest for these tests. 
            However, Puppeteer does not come with all good things; we found that it is incompatible with our own global variables 
            that refer to the page and the browser, thus we were limited to what the library gave us. Sometimes we found that the 
            browser environment was not the same on all the machines and we had errors of <code>this.global.page.close</code> cannot be 
            called as it is undefined in the environment. However, on some machines this would work perfectly. <br><br> 
            
            Overall we tried to create a codebase that worked on all machines.
            After setting up the end-to-end testing framework, we began on writing the tests. We focused on covering all functionalities of our 
            platform for ensuring that we were confident of having no bugs and that our platform is fully functional. We did this 
            step-by-step by going through each use case of our platform and noting what actions these may require on our platform. 
            We also focused on testing the security of our platform so we tested whether users with limited permissions could 
            access parts of our platform that require more permissions.
            
            With a total of 13 tests, we were able to pass all of them on both Firefox and Chrome complying with compatibility testing
            as seen in the diagram below:
