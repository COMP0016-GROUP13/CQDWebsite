            RESEARCH SUMMARY
        </div>

        <div class="h4 col text-center" style="margin: 1em 0 1em 0;">
            Before proceeding with the project, we did some extensive research on the technical choices that we have to make in order to implement the extended dashboard. These include the programming language, frameworks, authentication system and technology stacks.
            From the previous iteration of this project, we had a web stack given to us to use. However this stack seemed quite “over-the-top” for our requirements and the middleware SSO, which is Keycloak, was completely new and had very little documentation
            for us to adapt to. Our team only had one member familiar with web development and this was only in the front-end. Migrating the whole codebase to something such as Django, while easier to use and understand, would take much more time than
            required, and while we were doing that, we would have adapted to the new stack in the process. The following diagram simplifies the stack implemented for our dashboard along with the related project that we researched on:

            RELATED PROJECT REVIEW
        </div>

        <div class="h4 col text-center" style="margin: 1em 0 1em 0;">
            The Care Quality Dashboard development was started by group 20 from the 2020/2021 cohort of UCL's Industry Exchange Network (IXN)
            <span style="color: #e84d00;">[1]</span> and our team is responsible for extending this project by adding more useful features for the clinicians from NHS Wales. Therefore, the most important project that we have study is the pre-existing
            project structure. The project codes have been well-documented by the previous team and it helps us in understanding the features available at present. <br><br> After studying the codes of the previous team available on Github<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [2]</span>,
            we can conclude some of the main features of the dashboard. Firstly, the main component of the dashboard is the self-evaluation page. This is the central function of the platform, which is to allow for clinicians' self-reports. Next, another
            great feature is that statistics of these clinicians can be displayed in an interactive manner. The statistics can also be filtered according to dates and departments, which is great for supervision by supervisors on fellow clinicians. Finally,
            a main feature that is available on the pre-existing website is the ability of administrators to manage the users, questions, departments and even, health boards using the application. This feature is very fundamental in order to ensure the
            platform can be expanded and used across various different departments. <br><br> In essence, we have learnt a lot just by looking at the codes from the previous team. First and foremost, we managed to understand the basics on how to set up
            the project. This is because the github repository comes with a README.md file<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [3]</span>, which helps in setting up the environment of the system. Not just that, we also learnt how the various different techical
            components are integrated and used together to ensure the usability of the platform. Also, by reading through the architecture documentation<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [4]</span> of the dashboard, we gained a high-level view of how the
            front-end and back-end are connected.

                WEB DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
            </div>

            <div class="h4 col text-center" style="margin: 1em 0 2em 0;">
                Since our client is inclined towards creating an online accesible web application, it is important for us to ensure that most devices can support the running of our program. For creating such web application, we have a few choices of programming languages
                to be used to structure our project. After doing our own research, we narrowed down the possible languages to two: JavaScript and Python. However, after further discussions, our team decided to go forward with JavaScript. The reason why
                we did not choose Python was because it is a backend server-side programming language. This being said, Python cannot be utilised on its own because it needs to work with requests involving HTML, CSS and even JavaScript
                <span style="color: #e84d00;"> [5]</span>. Additionally, even with the existance of frameworks for website development using Python such as Django available, it will be a steep learning curve for us to easily code using Python. Finally,
                the performance of websites created using Python may be poor because of its slower speed in comparison to JavaScript<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [6]</span>.<br><br> On the other hand, JavaScript is generally a more popular choice of
                programming language used in web development (web-dev). Based on a 2021 survey carried out by Stack Overflow, out of 83,052 respondents, about 65 percent of them use JavaScript as their main language for web-dev<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [7]</span>.
                As such, it is easier for us to gain help from the community in case we encounter any problem during development. Also, JavaScript has the advantage of speed, which is useful to save time of the clinicians using our platform. The image
                below depicts the statistics mentioned above<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [7]</span>. <br><br> Finally, we have decided to develop or project using JavaScript because of all the possible benefits and convenience that we can gain by its
                usage. Not to forget, since this is a legacy project written mostly in JavaScript, it would be hard for us to rewrite all of the exisiting code using another language as this will consume a lot of our time.<br><br>

            <div class="h4 col text-center" style="margin: 1em 0 2em 0;">
                After deciding to use JavaScript as our main programming language, we explored the various different libraries available for use. For our front-end, we decided that React is suitable to be integrated into our system due to several deciding factors but
                largely due to the fact that it is the most popular libraries in use for website development, with competition from Angular and Vue.js. According to npm-stat, about 500 million downloads of React has been recorded in 2021 alone. With this
                large community using the library, we believe there must be great support available for helping our project development<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [8]</span>. Some of the many advantages of incorporating this library
                in our project include increased speed and performance of the website.
                <span style="color: #e84d00;"> [9]</span>. <br><br>

                <div class="container">

                </div>

                As React is a good choice of library for web-development, we decided to implement the React suite within the Next.js framework in order to develop single page Javascript applications<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [10]</span>. React is
                built on top of Node.js, which enables React-based functionalities including server-side rendering. Below are some of the benefits we can gain by implementing the Next.js framework. <br><br>

                <div class="container">
                    <li>
                        <span style="color: #00a2e8;">Server-side Rendering (SSR)</span> - React components on the front-end of the website are rendered on the server side. This leads to a much faster loading time for users<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [11]</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span style="color: #00a2e8;">Automatic Code Splitting</span> - Reducing the size of the application by splitting the codes into smaller pieces or chunks and only load the chunks as needed. This also increases the speed of loading
                        for the webpages<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [12]</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span style="color: #00a2e8;">Static Page Generation</span> - Websites are rendered at build time to output static HTML files along with assets such as JavaScript and CSS. This ultimately results in an <i>ultra fast</i> loading
                        experience for all users, according to Next.js themselves.<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [13]</span>

                    VISUALISATION TECHNOLOGIES
                </div>

                <div class="h4 col text-center" style="margin: 1em 0 2em 0;">
                    For a given dashboard, visualising the progress of health and care standards is essential. Also, visualisation help senior staff to supervise fellow clinicians. The previous implementation of the Care Quality Dashboard used Chart.js for visualisations,
                    but we decided to look into alternative graphing libraries. We then found the JavaScript library, D3.js, which is mainly used to create interactive data visualisations. The table below shows a summary of the comparisons made between
                    chart.js and D3.js <span style="color: #e84d00;"> [14]</span>:

                    <div class="container" style="padding: 0 0 1em 0;">

                    </div>

                    From our research, we decided to continue using the Chart.js library. This is because Chart.js is beginner-friendly which makes it a great fit considering the team's background in web development. Also our system does not require a complex graphical visualisation,
                    but instead we just need to display a line graph. Therefore, using the Chart.js Line component will aid us in creating the visualisation effectively and quickly without causing unnecessary complications.<br><br>

            <div class="h4 col text-center" style="margin: 1em 0 2em 0;">
                To ensure that users can authenticate themselves in order to use the dashboard, it is incredibly important to have a secure way of logging in users into the system. It is also important to find a system, which is easily understood by users as we do not
                want to over-complicate them. Therefore, we considered three different login systems: Keycloak, Microsoft Azure Single Sign On (SSO) and NHS Identity. <br><br> At first we are very inclined towards NHS Identity because
                it should be intuitive to use by NHS users as the system has already been implemented within the organisation. NHS Identity is actually the current technology for healthcare personnels to authenticate themselves for accessing England's
                clinical information systems<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [15]</span>. However, after doing some research, we found out that this system may not be able to be used for our platform due to several reasons. Firstly, NHS Identity is mostly
                in use in England for NHS England. Therefore, it is quite hard for our dashboard to be used by NHS Wales if we choose to utilise this login system because most clinicians in Wales cannot even access it. Secondly, only staff with a smart
                card can authenticate themselves using the NHS Identity. In fact, not all NHS staff have the card mentioned above, hence, this method may not be viable for our self-evaluating platform. <br><br> Another option we have in hand is Microsoft
                Azure Single Sign On (SSO) system for authentication of users. Using this method, the login process would have been offloaded to Microsoft and would have saved development time. However, we do have a lot of different roles to be created
                and assigned to different NHS staff. By using the SSO, we would have to manually assign roles to users and this can be a huge inconvenience for our team.<br><br> Keycloak is another option that we have at hand. According to its documentation,
                Keycloak is an identity and access management solution (IAM) which has been used by various applications for authentication purposes and it was developped by RedHat, the largest open-source software manufacturer<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [16]</span>.
                It is a secure authentication system with multiple useful features, which will be a good fit to be integrated into our dashboard<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [17]</span>. Some of the features include high-performance due its lightweight
                nature, Single Sign-On (SSO) for multiple applications and centralised management for users and administrations. In comparison with the Microsoft Azure Single Sign On (SSO), Keycloak has an in-built feature to help assign roles to users
                of the system, which is a huge advantage for us. Below is the simplification of all the features, taken from its official website, that shows how Keycloak would make a good candidate for us to manage our login system<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [18]</span>.
