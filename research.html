            RESEARCH SUMMARY
        </div>

        <div class="h4 col text-center" style="margin: 1em 0 1em 0;">
            Before proceeding with the project, we did some extensive research on the technical choices that we 
            have to make in order to implement the dashboard. These include the programming language, frameworks,
            authentication system and technology stacks. In short, the list below simplifies the key decisions that 
            we have decided on for this project. We also included the related project that we have done research on.

            RELATED PROJECT REVIEW
        </div>

        <div class="h4 col text-center" style="margin: 1em 0 1em 0;">
            The Care Quality Dashboard development was started by group 20 from the 2020/2021 cohort of UCL's Industry Exchange Network (IXN)
            <span style="color: #e84d00;">[1]</span> and our team is responsible 
            for extending this project by adding more useful features for the clinicians from NHS Wales. Therefore, the most important
            project that we have study is the pre-existing project structure. The project codes have been well-documented by the previous 
            team and it helps us in understanding the features available at present. <br><br>

            After studying the codes of the previous team available on Github<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [2]</span>, we can conclude some of the main features of the dashboard.
            Firstly, the main component of the dashboard is the self-evaluation page. This is the central function of the platform, which is 
            to allow for clinicians' self-reports. Next, another great feature is that statistics of these clinicians can be displayed in an 
            interactive manner. The statistics can also be filtered according to dates and departments, which is great for supervision by supervisors
            on fellow clinicians. Finally, a main feature that is available on the pre-existing website is the ability of administrators to 
            manage the users, questions, departments and even, health boards using the application. This feature is very fundamental in order to 
            ensure the platform can be expanded and used across various different departments. <br><br>

            In essence, we have learnt a lot just by looking at the codes from the previous team. First and foremost, we managed to understand 
            the basics on how to set up the project. This is because the github repository comes with a README.md file<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [3]</span>, which helps in setting up 
            the environment of the system. Not just that, we also learnt how the various different techical components are integrated and used 
            together to ensure the usability of the platform. Also, by reading through the architecture documentation<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [4]</span> of the dashboard, we gained
            a high-level view of how the front-end and back-end are connected.

                WEB DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
            </div>

            <div class="h4 col text-center" style="margin: 1em 0 2em 0;">
                Since our client is inclined towards creating an online accesible web application, it is important for us to ensure that most devices
                can support the running of our programme. For creating such web application, we have a few choices of programming languages to be used 
                to structure our project. After doing our own research, we narrowed down the possible languages to two: JavaScript and Python. However,
                after further discussions, our team decided to go forward with JavaScript. The reason why we did not choose Python was because it is a 
                backend server-side programming language. This being said, Python cannot be utilised on its own because it needs to work with requests 
                involving HTML, CSS and even JavaScript<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [5]</span>. Additionally, even with the existance of frameworks for website development using Python 
                such as Django available, it will be a steep learning curve for us to easily code using Python. Finally, the performance of websites 
                created using Python may be poor because of its slower speed in comparison to JavaScript<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [6]</span>.<br><br>

                On the other hand, JavaScript is generally a more popular choice of programming language used in web development (web-dev). Based on a 2021 survey carried out by 
                Stack Overflow, out of 83,052 respondents, about 65 percent of them use JavaScript as their main language for web-dev<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [7]</span>. As such, it
                is easier for us to gain help from the community in case we encounter any problem during development. 
                Also, JavaScript has the advantage of speed, which is useful to save time of the clinicians using our platform. The image below depicts the 
                statistics mentioned above<span style="color: #e84d00;"> [7]</span>. <br><br>
